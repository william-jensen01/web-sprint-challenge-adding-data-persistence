# Adding Data Persistence Sprint Challenge

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This sprint explored **Data Persistence**. During this sprint, you studied **RDBMS, including SQL, multi-table queries, and data modeling**. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate your mastery of these skills by creating **a database based on given specifications**.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

## Project Set Up

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository. (Not Lambda's by mistake!)
- [ ] Implement the project in a new branch: `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Create and push commits regularly: `git push origin <firstName-lastName>`.

## Project Instructions

### Introduction

In this project you will be given a set of requirements and must design a database to satisfy them. As a part of this process you'll also build an API with endpoints to access the data.

### Tables

Use appropriate data types and constraints:

A **project** is what needs to be done and is stored in a `projects` table with the following columns:

- [ ] `project_id` - primary key
- [ ] `project_name` - required
- [ ] `project_description` - optional
- [ ] `project_completed` - required but the database defaults it to not completed if not provided

A **resource** is anything needed to complete a project and is stored in a `resources` table with the following columns:

- [ ] `resource_id` - primary key
- [ ] `resource_name` - required and unique
- [ ] `resource_description` - optional

A **task** is one of the steps needed to complete a project and is stored in a `tasks` table with the following columns:

- [ ] `task_id` - primary key
- [ ] `task_description` - required
- [ ] `task_notes` - optional
- [ ] `task_completed` - required but the database defaults it to not completed if not provided
- [ ] `project_id` - required and points to an actual `project_id` in the `projects` table

A **resource assignment** connects a resource and a project, and is stored in a `project_resources` table. You decide what columns to use.

### Requirements

Your finished project must meet all of the following requirements:

- [ ] Design the data model and use knex migrations to create the database and tables.
- [ ] Build an API inside the `api` folder with endpoints for:

  - [ ] `[POST] /api/resources`
    - Example of response body: `{"resource_id":1,"resource_name":"foo","resource_description":null}`

  - [ ] `[GET] /api/resources`
    - Example of response body: `[{"resource_id":1,"resource_name":"foo","resource_description":null}]`

  - [ ] `[POST] /api/projects`
    - Even though `project_completed` is stored as an integer, the API uses booleans when interacting with the client
    - Example of response body: `{"project_id":1,"project_name":"bar","project_description":null,"project_completed":false}`

  - [ ] `[GET] /api/projects`
    - Even though `project_completed` is stored as an integer, the API uses booleans when interacting with the client
    - Example of response body: `[{"project_id":1,"project_name":"bar","project_description":null,"project_completed":false}]`

  - [ ] `[POST] /api/tasks`
    - Even though `task_completed` is stored as an integer, the API uses booleans when interacting with the client
    - Example of response body: `{"task_id":1,"task_description":"baz","task_notes":null,"task_completed":false,"project_id:1}`

  - [ ] `[GET] /api/tasks`
    - Even though `task_completed` is stored as an integer, the API uses booleans when interacting with the client
    - Each task must include `project_name` and `project_description`
    - Example of response body: `[{"task_id":1,"task_description":"baz","task_notes":null,"task_completed":false,"project_name:"bar","project_description":null}]`

**Notes:**

- You are welcome to create additional files for middlewares etc, but **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
- Do not make changes to your `package.json` except to add extra dependencies and scripts.
- In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
- Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work.
- It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Stretch Goals

**IMPORTANT:** Work on stretch goals in a **new branch**. You can branch off `<firstName-lastName>` by executing `git checkout -b stretch`.

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

- [ ] Add an endpoint to get a list of project resources.
- [ ] Add an endpoint to get a list of project tasks.
- [ ] Add an endpoint to see all projects using a particular resource.

## Submission format

There are two possible ways to submit this project to Canvas. Lambda Staff will let you know which one applies:

1. Submitting a pull request to merge `<firstName-lastName>` (or `stretch` if you finished any stretch goals) branch into `main`.
2. Setting up your fork settings on Github to submit via Codegrade by pushing commits to your `<firstName-lastName>` branch.

## Interview Questions

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. You might prepare by writing down your own answers before hand.

1. Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.
A: In relational databases, the data is stored in tabular format grouped into rows and columns. SQL is the query language for managing databases and allows us to retrieve information from the relational database.

2. Why do tables need a Primary Key?
A: Tables have a primary key to uniquely identify each row.

3. What is the name given to a table column that references the Primary Key on another table?
A: A foreign key

4. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables?
A: We need a third table to connect the 2 tables to each other
